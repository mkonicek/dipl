    abstract = {This thesis defines a set of program restructuring operations (refactorings) that support the design, evolution and reuse of object-oriented application frameworks. The focus of the thesis is on automating the refactorings in a way that preserves the behavior of a program. The refactorings are defined to be behavior preserving, provided that their preconditions are met. Most of the refactorings are simple to implement and it is almost trivial to show that they are behavior preserving. However,...},
